Game Info:
You challenge the Tictactoe god: TiK
Enter 1 to continue enter 2 to quit.
When prompted with "Your move mortal" This means enter the number position you want to put your "X" piece in.
Tik plays "O" you play "X" 

This is the position layout on the Board

0 | 1 | 2
----------
3 | 4 | 5
----------
6 | 7 | 8
---------

When you initially start the game this is the initial board layout shown
A | A | A
----------
A | A | A
----------
A | A | A
----------


A square with "A" means it is available to input either "X" or "O"
To input X as the player when promted with:
"Your move mortal"
Enter the position you wish to play X into right beside the prompt
Given the intial board and the prompt if we enter 0 as the position the board is printed as 

X | A | A
----------
A | A | A
----------
A | A | A
----------
Since that is the 0 position as shown in the position layout.
When you see the prompt my move this means that Tik is playing;
the board shown after that prompt is the result of his move.

This is all the information you need to play, the game follows the regular rules of Tictactoe
